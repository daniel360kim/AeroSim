# AeroSim - 1.0 Initial Release
This simulation calculates the Coefficient of axial drag, pressure, skin friction, and base pressure of a rocket along with air density, Reynolds Number and critical Reynold's Number. 
This is the initial release that only calculates these values at a single velocity and at zero angle of attack.

# Properties to measure
The surface height of the rocket is needed. OpenRocket defaults to 60micrometers. This depends on the rocket's material
Length of the nosecone and length of body tube. - This sim only allows for conical nose cones (for now)
Diameter of the rocket. 
This sim assumes the nose cone and body tube have the same diameter and surfaceheight.

More details with further revisions!
